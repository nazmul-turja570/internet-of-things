IoT based Waste Management System: Here we have IoT based prototype with sensors to measure the waste volume in containers or wastebins, with facility to transmit information over the Internet. The system is simulated in for the city of Dhaka, using Firebase real time database. The simulation covers a period of one week to model wastebin filling and waste collection. Their simulations are done for performing an efficiency comparison of different ways for collection of wastes: Traditional method and dynamic on-demand solution, proposed work (intelligent) for several cases.
