IoT based Home Automation: This project won the Battle of Hardware in "CSE Festival, 2018". It consists of 5 fans and 5 lights which can be controlled via an android app named "Hawkbit". This app can control the brightness of the lights and also can control the speed of the fan. 

IoT based Waste Management System: This project was one of the finalist of CISCO Hackathon, 2018, Dhaka, Bangladesh. It consists of two parts. Sender part and receiver part. The sender part will be stuck with a waste bin, sending constant signal of the current level of wastes of the waste bin to the cloud data. The receiver part is centrally located at a singular location. The central part processes the data and sends signal to the nearest garbage collector when necessary. There is an android app named "Wastie" which was used to alarm for the garbage collector. The alarm can also be used as a message
